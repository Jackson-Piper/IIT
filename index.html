      <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <div class="intro">
          <p>I was born in Melbourne, Australia but I grew up in Sydney. I graduated from high school in 2015 and decided to take a gap year at that point. Since then, I fell in love with the snow and have been working as a Ski Instructor. This has allowed me to spend three seasons working and living in Niseko, Japan one season in PyeongChang, South Korea and this year will be my fifth season working in Australia. I have also skied in America, Canada and New Zealand. Besides, Skiing/Snowboarding I also enjoy reading, Disc Golf and cooking.</p>

      <h2>Why I.T.</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Intrest</h3>
            <div class="everythingelse">
              <p>My interest in IT started when I was just a young boy. My grandfather would spend many hours on the computer playing different strategy games and after enough nagging from myself he finally showed me how to play, and I subsequently fell in love with them. Since then, I have always been fascinated with the latest technological advancements. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="clear"></div>
              <h3>Where to Study?</h3>
                <div class="everythingelse">
                  <p>As I grew older my interest shifted from more “That’s cool” to “I wonder how that works”. This led me to a yearning for improving my own knowledge. Which in turn made me finally realize what I wanted to do with my life. Which is how I ended up studying at RMIT, I had heard many great things about it, my father also attended back when he was studying, and through Open Universities Australia it provided the perfect learning environment.</p>
            </div><div class="clear"></div>
          <h3>Expectations</h3>
            <div class="everythingelse">
              <p>While Studying here I have already started to learn so much more than I thought I would have in this time. Being enrolled in both Introduction to Programming and Introduction to IT has so far started to give me skills in programming and planning while describing what working in the industry is like. I expect to further cement these skills throughout my studies while getting used to working in a team environment more and expanding my knowledge of different code languages.</p>

          <h3>Background</h3>
            <div class="everythingelse">
              <p>Roam Creative are looking for a Backend Developer to help create innovative and leading-edge applications that are stable and smooth, this will require many hours of problem solving which I look for in a job. They also may require you to travel for work, which is something I have done in the past and enjoy immensely, as the company has a heavy emphasis on reaching the client’s needs, but ultimately being based in Sydney. This job immediately leapt out at me as a “close nit group” is exactly the size workspace I believe I work best in.</p>
            </div>
          <div class="clear"></div>
            <h3>Skills</h3>
              <div class="everythingelse">
                  <p>The skills required for the job are varied as good communication skills and understanding the client’s needs are just as important to this role as knowledge in Node.js, JavaScript Itself and an overall understanding of applications inception, development and then execution. Especially writing web applications as this is a prerequisite for the job.</p>
              </div>
          <div class="clear"></div>
            <h3>What i need to learn</h3>
              <div class="everythingelse">
                  <p>While personally I am lacking in a lot of the technical side of the job having only just started my training in the IT field, my knowledge and experience dealing with clients and communication is vast. Working as a Ski Instructor you must not only understand the goals your client has, but also be able to efficiently and effectively communicate the necessary information so they can learn and understand, every client is different and requires a different level of problem solving. I have planned to gain the technical skills through studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, with focusing on expanding my expertise on different programming languages through writing multiple applications myself.</p>

            <h3>What do they mean to me?</h3>
              <div class="everythingelse">
                <p>I believe the results tended to represent me how I see myself and how I believe others see me. These test however must be taken with a grain of salt as I believe that it is hard for most people to give a clear self-assessment or representation of themselves when filling out the answers. However, I do believe that I learn best when given the chance to think things through properly and then reflect on what I could have done better. I believe this lends itself to my Democratic leading style as taking my time and making sure everyone understands and or is onboard with the direction the team is going is important to me. Now obviously it is nice hearing you are apparently one of the rarest personality types getting to compare myself to the likes of Elon Musk and Friedrich Nietzsche , but again I believe myself to be more caring and observant than the profile describes me as.</p>
              </div>
            <div class="clear"></div>
            <h3>Influences on me</h3>
            <div class="everythingelse">
              <p>I do not believe these results will influence me much when working with my colleagues as I already know who I am. While they may be more impactful for my future learning rather than this assignment or future team building, I still will not hide them from my team members. I believe that if I had received other results that I disagreed with I may have strived to prove them wrong. Th biggest difference for me personally will be to use the results of the learning styles test to help better my knowledge and understanding of the tasks assigned to me for the good of the team.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="clear"></div>
            <h3>Picking a team</h3>
              <div class="everythingelse">
                <p>When looking for my team members for the coming assignments in this study period I am going to try and look for like minded people. These results have just reenforced the types of people I will strive to work with and work under. I do not want to choose someone who leans more towards Authoritarian leadership or someone who will shill on their responsibilities. These will only hamper the groups progress and therefore mine as well.</p>

        <h2>My Project</h2>
          <article>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
              <div class="everythingelse">
                <p>I want to create an application that is a personalized database of the contents of any individuals home bar. This application will have the ease and convenience of being accessible from any mobile device at any time. It will allow the user to see what they have in stock, what they have been using and make suggestions as to what they may enjoy drinking or any deals that may be available to them through local bottle shops. It will also contain personalized recipe books for cocktails that user has enjoyed or ones they have created at home.</p>
                  </div>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <h3>Why?</h3>
                <div class="everythingelse">
                  <p>While the issue itself of keeping track of what is behind one’s bar may seem trivial it is something that I know certain people need. My parents and myself for example tend to forget what we respectively have at home and therefore are often disappointed thinking we had something we did not, also for those who travel between holiday homes and such remembering what you left behind may be taxing at times. This is a project that I have been running through my head for years now with no real knowledge on how to achieve it but now given this opportunity I am ready to start work on it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="clear"></div>
              <h3>Features</h3>
                <div class="clear"></div>
                  <h4>First Stage</h4>
                    <div class="everythingelse">
                      <p>The main feature of the application is a personalized database to be able to organize and keep stock of the alcohol and other bar supplies in your home or small business bar. It will differ from the other services as it will not restrict the user to types of liquor or certain brands. Instead letting using upload their own photos or details of items that are not in our database. This will allow a user greater detail to what they have in their bar rather than just the type of spirit.</p>
                      <p>In addition to this each bottle with be editable meaning, you will be able to keep track of how full or empty the bottle is, how many bottles you have and be given alerts or updates when you are running out of certain items. These reminders or updates can be set weekly so that you will not forget while you are out on your weekly shop.</p>
                      <p> The database itself will be accessible through the mobile application, and with the bottle and stock represented in a variety of different ways in which the user can pick. The amount of stock will also be represented in each bottle and if our service does not have a picture of the bottle to represent it the user can upload one themselves. </p>
                      <p>Moving forward from here a separate database will have a vast array of cocktail recipes, history of the drinks, ideas and a section to add your own personal recipes. Both databases will have a search function, allowing you to find your desired drink/beverage by name, type and price. Instructional YouTube videos will be available for those unexperienced or looking to cement their skills.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                  <h4>Stretch Goal</h4>
                    <div class="everythingelse">
                      <p>Additionally, to these features I will endeavor to also provide a simple review system to allow the users feedback on the items they have purchased and help suggest items other users with similar taste recommend</p>
                      <p>These reviews will also help our systems to make suggestions to the user on their future purchases. I will approach companies such as B.W.S (Beer Wine Spirts), Vintage Cellars and Dan Murphy’s to provide a realistic database of drinks available in the surrounding area and a comparable price, to get the most out of each bottle.</p>
                      <p>The additional features that I also want to achieve for this project will have the stock analyzed and suggest other items the user may or may not have tried. This will link into the shopping side of the app with links on where to obtain the different items and have a price comparison for minimal cost to the user. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
              <h3>The Tech.</h3>
                <div class="everythingelse">
                  <p>I will be using Atom, a source code editor with Git and GitHub enabled features. GitHub is where I will be planning and storing my project while it is in the development phase. Swift and Objective-C are the two languages I will be focusing on as they are ideal for working in the Apple ecosystem. An Oracle Database will be implemented for its data warehousing capabilities. Finally, I will also require a combined web and database server for the user with at least 2x 1.6 Ghz CPU, 3.5 GB RAM, 2x 40 Gb HHD for storage and access of the application.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="clear"></div>
              <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <div class="everythingelse">
                  <p>As it stands, I do not have the skill requirements to meet the needs of this application. I have little experience with programing in general and no knowledge of Swift or Objective-C which I would have to learn on top of integrating multiple databases into one efficient system. Feasibly it is possible for me to overcome these steps however with my current budget it would not be achievable to attain the necessary hardware required. The software however is all open source and readily available if I do not have it already.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="clear"></div>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
                <div class="everythingelse">
                  <p>The impact of this development may not be felt by everyone in the world or even most people in the world. Nevertheless, if this project is successful it will be felt for those it does help it would be a life changer in how they organize this often seem ably unorganizable mess. An easy to use easy to access way to organize a personal or small business bar would be within reach for those wanting it.</p>
